# **Step-by-Step Process to Complete the Excel Task**

1. **Understanding the Dataset**

   * First, I examined the dataset to understand its structure, the type of data contained, and any inconsistencies.
   * Identified columns, headers, and potential areas that required formatting or cleaning.
   * Checked for empty cells, misaligned rows, and extra spaces that might interfere with analysis.

2. **Adjusting Column Widths**

   * To make the dataset readable, I used the **keyboard shortcut Alt + H + O + I** to auto-fit all columns.
   * This ensured that each column width was adjusted automatically according to the content inside, avoiding text cut-offs.
   * Proper column sizing made it easier to visualize data without scrolling unnecessarily.

3. **Adjusting Row Heights**

   * Similarly, I applied **Alt + H + O + A** to auto-fit all rows.
   * This automatically adjusted row heights to match the largest content in each row.
   * By doing this, the dataset became more readable, and all text was fully visible, reducing manual adjustments.

4. **Inserting New Columns**

   * In cases where additional data fields were required or calculations were needed, I inserted new columns using **Ctrl + Shift + Plus (+)**.
   * This allowed for structured expansion of the dataset without disrupting existing data.
   * Inserted columns were labeled appropriately to maintain clarity and avoid confusion.

5. **Deleting Unnecessary Columns**

   * Columns that were irrelevant or contained redundant data were removed using **Ctrl + -**.
   * Removing unnecessary columns streamlined the dataset, reduced clutter, and made subsequent steps more efficient.
   * Ensured that only relevant data was retained for analysis.

6. **Selecting Data Efficiently**

   * To apply formatting or perform operations across large tables, I selected the dataset using **Ctrl + Shift + Down Arrow**.
   * This selected all rows in the column from the current cell to the end of the data.
   * It helped in performing actions like formatting, deleting, or preparing data for further processing efficiently.

7. **Manual Cleaning of Data**

   * Reviewed the dataset for inconsistencies such as extra spaces, typos, or missing values.
   * Corrected errors manually to maintain data integrity.
   * Standardized headings, text formatting, and numeric values to create uniformity across the dataset.

8. **Preparing for Analysis**

   * After cleaning, ensured that the table was well-structured with proper headers, no blank rows or columns.
   * Applied **bold formatting for headers** and enabled **filters** to facilitate sorting and filtering during analysis.
   * Verified that all data was aligned correctly, making it ready for any calculations, charts, or reports.

9. **Final Review and Verification**

   * Conducted a final review to ensure that all steps were completed and the data was clean and properly formatted.
   * Verified that column widths and row heights were consistent and that no important information was lost during cleaning.
   * Ensured the dataset was ready for any further processing or submission.
